#Group Members

Elli Houtakker, Nolan You, Logan Begin, Sharvil Dace, Thong Nguyen


#Communication

In order to communicate efficiently, we have a group chat where we can ask questions or plan our next meetings. We have found that we can all meet on ____, so we will plan on reconvening each week at this time to discuss progress and make sure everything is being completed in a timely manner. We have also created a Github to share our documents between each other. 


#Questions of Interest

"The topic selected must be unanimous among group members.
Each question should be in the form of a research question which may be supported or refuted by the data analysis and typically proposes or predicts a relationship between some variables in the study.
Note that your project should aim to answer a limited number of questions (preferably one) using data from one or more source.
Do not try to answer too many questions. Better projects will have a focused set of one or two questions."

#Data

We will be analyzing the data from: 



#Description of Data

"Who collected the data?
How were the data collected?
What are key variables in the data set, what do they measure, and how are they related to your key questions?
If the data may be thought of as a sample from some larger population, what is that larger population?"

#Graph Description

"Include a description of a graph which will show how the data informs the primary question of interest.
Describe what variables you will include and what type of graph you will create."

#Other models or methods of inference/prediction
