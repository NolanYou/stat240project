# READ BELOW IF EDITING!!

Hey guys!

Please use the CoronaryHeartDisease_and_Stroke.rmd file when editing the draft. I added everyone's sections to it, so if we could just keep editing that same one that would be great!!
Also, please double check that I didn't forget anything from your edits and double check that you have the correct {r, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE} for each r chunk. Each chunk should have the warning = FALSE, but the other ones might change depending on it you want to include it in the knit file or if it is just preliminary calculations. 

Let's aim to have all edits done by SUNDAY and turn in draft on MONDAY!!
