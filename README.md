# READ BELOW IF EDITING!!

Hey guys!

Please use the CoronaryHeartDisease_and_Stroke.rmd file when editing the draft. I added everyone's sections to it, so if we could just keep editing that same one that would be great. 
Also, please double check that I didn't forget anything from your edits and double check that you have the correct {r, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE} for each r chunk. Each chunk should have the warning = FALSE, but the other ones might change depending on it you want to include it in the knit file or if it is just preliminary calculations. 

Nolan - can you do the analysis summary paragraph. It should be before the tibble I created and just summarizes the analysis and hypothesis tests.
Logan - Could you double check that the hypothesis conclusion for stroke in the race test is correctly interpretated?

Let's aim to have all edits done by Friday so we don't have to do much over the weekend!
