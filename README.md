Notes/Questions:
- It is really hard to do a t distribution or hypothesis test on the age as the data is clearly not similar. I am not sure what to set the null hypothesis to (for ex: what are we testing or asking..? Are the age distribution affected by heart more than stroke? They clearly differ but by how much..??
     - can someone take a look at this and get back to me on thoughts? / or talk about it on Friday and let me know what you come up with
     
- Also, I made a lot of other t distribution tests for sex and race. If there are any other ones or analysis you want to add, feel free.
