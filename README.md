# IMPORTANT:

These are the remaining peer reviews that I have not yet made changes for. PLEASE use these to see what to edit and delete the sentence once you have completed them. Also make sure you download the recent file... there are many changes!!!


Peer reviews:

Graphs: 

It also seems that some of your graphs are extraneous, for you offer both a scatter plot and a box plot each time when these seem to each carry the same information and you only really need to choose one to include.

Analysis: 

Also when discussing hypothesis testing you talk about testing to see if the means for the 2 categories are equal or if they are not equal. I’m not sure if hypothesis testing gives you grounds to conclude they are not equal, I think it just gives evidence against them being equal. Also, for your race hypothesis tests you only test black and asian when it seems white has a mean heavily differing from the population at large by looking at your graphs. Lastly, it does not seem like you used a statistical model to analyze the second research question and only included graphical displays. I think you should try to answer this question using a statistical model. 

Interpretation: 

The conclusions that are drawn for the first research question are mainly supported by your statistical evidence. The interpretations are also being made in clear language for the most part. I notice how you say “there is not evidence to conclude that the mean mortality rate from stroke is different between men and women”. Again, I do not think finding a low p-value allows you to conclude that the means are different, rather it just provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis. Same goes for when you state “there is a difference between the groups, and we can see that by its low p value…” . I also think you should mention other possible statistical models that could be used for the data in your discussion section, such as logistic regression (since you are using categorical variables), etc.
