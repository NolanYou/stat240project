# stat240project

For Friday...

Hey Group! 
  I included a file for the outline which is due Monday. I added my section to it already, but please let me know if you want me to change any part of it. Also, can you look at the analysis section in the draft. Does that look okay? Too long? Thoughts?
 Logan, can you help with the interpretation of the t distribution tests under each one? 

Have a good weekend guys!
